# Topic Modelling using LDA and Top2Vec

## Aim: To find the optimal number of topics for a given document

Topic modeling is the process of finding topics, as weighted sets of words, that best represent
the information of the documents. 

Two models have been implemented for this purpose-

1. LDA- It is a generative probabilistic model which describes each document as a mixture of topics and each topic as a distribution of words.
2. Top2Vec- It leverages joint document and word semantic embedding to find topic vectors.
